## Welcome!

Hello!! I'm a first-year PhD student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, information hub. My research interests including:

- **3D Generation and Reconstruction**
- **Large Language Models (particularly in the context of Human-AI Collaboration and AI4SCI)**
- **Multimodal Model Design**

 I'm honored to be supervised by [Prof.Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Ge Lin KAN](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/KAN-GeLin/gelin).

Hello!! I'm a PhD student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, information hub, CMA. My research interests including Human-AI Collaboration, public health, and the application of computer vision. I'm honored to be supervised by [Prof.Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Ge Lin KAN](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/KAN-GeLin/gelin). In the past year(Sep.2023 - May.2024) I was a master student in University of Pennsylvania, majoring in smart cities. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Zhejiang University in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Liangsheng Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0020046) and [Dr. Yuting Xie](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xieyuting).


### My past study experience

My past study includes spatial-temporal data (feel free to check my [portfolio](https://ruohaoli.github.io/portfolio/)), botany(bio-info and horticulture), and Deep Learning for Remote Sensing (recently I'm trying to build a autonomous system to predict the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico based on optimized YOLOv9).


### Some interesting Data-Visulization I've done before:
